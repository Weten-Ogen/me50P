The nlargest() and nsmallest() functions are most appropriate if you are trying to
find a relatively small number of items. If you are simply trying to find the single smallest
or largest item (N=1), it is faster to python use min() and max(). Similarly, if N is about the
same size as the collection itself, it is usually faster to sort it first and take a slice (i.e.,
use sorted(items)[:N] or sorted(items)[-N:]). It  python should be noted that the actual
implementation of nlargest() and nsmallest() is adaptive in how it operates and will
carry out some of these optimizations on your behalf (e.g., using sorting if N is close to
the same size as the input).Monty python is the name of the TV drama series.
